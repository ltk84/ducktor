## Future Development

It is essential to improve the machine learning models used in this application. We may increase the quality and quantity of the model training dataset through surveys of real data so that speech recognition and disease diagnosis can be performed more accurately. We can also extend diagnostic information such as symptom-based morbidity. In addition, another improvement that can be made is to combine the search for nearby healthcare facilities into the diagnosis to suggest to the user where to check and treat the diseases.

One of the other developments that can easily be done is to expand the response capabilities and content of the Chatbot. It is possible to identify more types of sentences and user purposes, from which there are more interesting and friendly responses. We can expand the interaction between the user and the Chatbot when performing the search for information about health, and disease. At this point, users can ask more specific questions so that the Chatbot can identify and search for relevant information.
